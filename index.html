    Hello! My name is Pratheek, you can call me P if you'd like. Welcome to my website!
    I am a second year student at Georgia Institute of Technology, majoring in Computational
    Media with a focus in Intelligence. I am an avid programmer who's skills primarily lay in Java and Python.
    I'm particularly interested in the human and data science applications of machine learning. I also have a
    concentration in Film, I love telling unique and deep stories to wide varieties of audiences, and I am excited
    to learn more about the applications of Machine Learning in modern film productions. I love exploring and
    discovering things, hence my favorite quote:

    I've been learning Java for 4 years now, both in and out of school. I've taken AP CS courses as well as
    intro to OOP. I am currently taking Data Structures and Algorithms. Outside of school, I was on Walton
    Robotics for 2 years, where we used Java and Python to program a robot as well as provide it with vision
    capabilities.
    <br> <br>
    As for Python, I've spent 3 years learning it. I mostly learned outside of school,
    in robotics and for my own projects. I'm in the process of taking LinkedIn Learning courses
    for Tensorflow, and I hope to obtain to developer's certificate sometime in the future.

    The other part of my thread seeks to connect computer science with Film. I intend to pursue a film minor
    while doing my CM degree.

      As I stated earlier, I love exploring. Learning the history and seeing the beauty of different places in the
      world is a passion of mine. I especially love exploring Europe, a continent which I hope to revisit very soon.
      I've also been all across the states, from California to New York to my hometown of Georgia. I also love
      visiting my home country of India, a place brimming with culture and <em>great</em> food.

      The picture here was taken near Savannah, Georgia after some friends and I hosted a summer camp for
      elementary and middle schoolers.
