    <p>
      My four years of experience with Java is a compound of diligent schoolwork
      and exploratory extracurricular activities. My basics were created and reinforced
      by my high school classes, specifically AP CSP and AP CSA. During this time, I was
      also a member of Team 2974 - Walton Robotics. While on my robotics team, I learned
      advanced and real world programming skills. I learned about Git and Github, as well
      as advanced OOP. I worked with a plethora of libraries (and made a few myself). I also
      implemented JUnit tests for our robot.
      <br> <br>
      College is when I began my deep dive into Java. During my freshman year, I took Intro to OOP.
      Currently I am taking Data Structures and Algorithms. One of my current degree threads is Intelligence,
      which focuses on ML and AI. I'm also focusing on personal projects which I will update as they finish.

<div class="PythonProgram">
  <h2 class="header2">Python: </h2>
  <p>
    My three years of Python experience is solely due to independent learning and extracurriculars.
    While on my robotics team, I learned how to program a limelight camera with Python. This was
    my biggest plunge into advanced Python during my high school years.
    <br> <br>
    Now in college I'm focusing on personal projects which I will update as they finish. I am also
    taking LinkedIn Learning courses on Tensorflow, and I am making Tensorflow Projects.
